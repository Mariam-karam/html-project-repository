<h2>AI in the past</h2>
For centuries, human anxiety has concerned the development of machines and systems that have a degree of intelligence in dealing with some problems and situations that a person faces in his daily life.  Many scholars and philosophers in ancient times have worked to develop scientific and logical approaches in order to simulate human intelligence and ways to produce logical thinking that can solve problems based on logic sciences.
<h2>AI in the present</h2>
n the 21st century, AI research has become highly specialized and technical, and it has been divided into deep subspecies so deep that they are so few to each other.  [138] The field sections grew around specific institutions, researchers worked, on solving specific problems, and differences of opinion a long time ago emerged over how artificial intelligence should work and the application of various tools on a large scale.
